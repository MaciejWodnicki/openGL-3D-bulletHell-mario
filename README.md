# openGL-3D-bulletHell-mario

This is a project of a OpenGL game where enemies spawn and move randomly around the player. The goal is to score points by jumping onto the enemy, while dodging bullets aimed directly at the player (can't shoot too high up or directly upwards). The project features directional light and shadows.
